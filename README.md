# Shell-Interpreter
This program implements a simple shell to process system calls.  It includes “cd” functionality via some builtin functions and the “chdir” command.  Backgrounding of processes is enabled via the command "bg x" where x is a desired process, and viewing of all current background processes can be done by entering the command bglist.
